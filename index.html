Getting tired of people making offers via text before they even look at your car? Getting tired of Craigslist and pretentious buyers?! I was. No joke, Kamal at San Diego Cash for Cars (who previously worked on my car at his mechanic shop and previously gave me best low price out of 6 mechanic shops!!) offered me $250 more than 3 other dealers. Score! Check him out at least before selling your car elsewhere! Or, his place of business off of Euclid in SD! Great guy will give you a good deal and honest experience.

Thank you for the quick service. The buyer, Kamal came over to look at my Honda Civic as it just died on me. He was very polite and funny. He gave me a price for the given the condition of the car. We had a moment of haggling but quickly agreed on a price (as it was dead). With the fact that I didn’t have to worry about transporting the car as he would tow it was well worth the phone call. The whole experience took less than an hour and was totally happy.

My wife and I were visiting San Diego to see some family and our car wouldn't start. This place was recommended by a family friend. They were VERY friendly, fast and fair.
